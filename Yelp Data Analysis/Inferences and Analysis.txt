Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

I analyzed the data of Toronto Restaurants & Phoenix Restaurants. The distribution of hours was just a little bit different. 
The restaurants having 4-5 stars rating seems to have less hours where as the restaurants with 2-3 stars rating have more hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes, the restaurants with 4-5 stars rating have more reviews than the restaurants with 2-3 stars rating
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No, every business is related to a different zip-code.

SQL code used for analysis:

		SELECT b.name, b.city,c.category, h.hours, AVG(b.review_count), postal_code,
		       CASE
			  	  WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			 	  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
			   ELSE '1 or less stars'
		      END AS star_rating
       		From business b
		Inner join hours h  ON b.id = h.business_id
		Inner join category c ON c.business_id = b.id
	WHERE city IN ('Toronto','Phoenix')
		AND category = 'Restaurants'
	GROUP BY name
	ORDER BY star_rating DESC	
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
Below is the resulting dataset;

i. Difference 1: Average review count of the closed businesses is less than the opened ones.
         
       
ii. Difference 2: No other difference in this particular category.

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT b.name, b.city,c.category, h.hours, AVG(b.review_count), postal_code, b.is_open,
		       CASE
			  	  WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			 	  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
			   ELSE '1 or less stars'
		      END AS star_rating
       		From business b
		Inner join hours h  ON b.id = h.business_id
		Inner join category c ON c.business_id = b.id
	WHERE city IN ('Toronto','Phoenix')
	AND category = 'Restaurants'
	GROUP BY name
	ORDER BY is_open DESC	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         I will analyze which business category is most popular.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
	I'll need stars rating, reviews count and the name of the business.
	I chose this because I wanted it know which categories of business are. ore popular globally.

         Within the categories, I compute the mean star rating, total reviews and total number of businesses for each category. To ensure statistical validity, I only focus on 25 categories with most businesses. 

The results reveal that;
	1.Restaurants have an average star rating of 3.45, with a substantial total of 3,772 reviews spread across 53 businesses.
	2.Shopping businesses exhibit a higher average star rating of 4.0, based on 945 reviews from 25 businesses.
	3.The Food category receives an average star rating of 3.73, derived from 1,588 reviews spanning 20 businesses.
	4.Health & Medical services showcase positive feedback, with an average star rating of 4.22 from 198 reviews across 16 businesses.
	5.Home Services have an average star rating of 3.93, derived from 91 reviews across 15 businesses.
	6.Beauty & Spas receive an average star rating of 3.79 based on 116 reviews from 12 businesses.
	7.Nightlife establishments receive an average star rating of 3.63, with a total of 952 reviews distributed among 12 businesses.
	8.Bars, with a slightly higher average star rating of 3.64, are represented by 945 reviews across 11 businesses.
	9.Active Life businesses demonstrate an average star rating of 4.15, based on 131 reviews from 10 businesses.
	10.Local Services have an exceptionally high average star rating of 4.35, with 94 reviews spread across 10 businesses.
