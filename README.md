## Overview
This Project is an assignment from [SQL For Data Science](https://coursera.org/share/af562401cc2e1311f74e6ef3acec7fb2) This project utilized the knowledge of a wide range of concepts and SQL design techniques discussed throughout the course. 

In this project, I played the role of a real-world data scientist using SQL to both answer specific questions for an organization and make inferences based on my discoveries. 

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.
