## Overview
This Project is an assignment from [SQL For Data Science](https://coursera.org/share/af562401cc2e1311f74e6ef3acec7fb2) This project utilized the knowledge of a wide range of concepts and SQL design techniques discussed throughout the course. 

In this project, I played the role of a real-world **Data Scientist** using SQL to both answer specific questions for an organization and make inferences based on my discoveries. 

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

In this section, a series of questions were posed with the primary goal of unraveling the composition and scale of the data, shedding light on its fundamental characteristics.
### Questions:
Following questions were addressed in this section:
1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables.
2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:
5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order.
6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities.
